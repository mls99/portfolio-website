      <h5>About</h5>
      <p>Hi, my name is Michael Schwartz and I am from Stony Brook, New York. I am currently a junior at Cornell University, studying information science and concentrating in UX Design. In addition, I am pursing a minor in Business.</p>
      <p>Originally, an environmental science major, my passion for design started when I took my first website design class INFO 1300. I was constantly wanting to keep updating and perfecting my sites, and couldn't stop.
        I wanted my work to be the best it could be, and was extremely satified with my work by the end of the semester. Due to my success in the class, I was able to become a teacher's assistant, and this has allowed me to refine and master my skills. In addition, I found joy in giving guidance and helping others. </p>
      <p>Outside of academics, I am on the Cornell Fencing Team. Being a varsity athelete as taught me how to be efficient with my time as the team has practice every weekday, and I am often traveling on weekends.
        I am also a research assistant for the Virtual Embodiment Lab. The lab explores a variety of virtual reality devices from 360-degree video to full virtual systems. I have run experiments, helped create avatars, and create 360-degree videos. </p>
      <p>I am always look for new oppertunities to create, design or just talk! Feel free to get in touch with with the links below!</p>
