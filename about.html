      <h5>About</h5>
      <p>Hi, my name is Michael Schwartz and I am from Stony Brook, New York. I am currently a junior at Cornell University, studying Information Science and concentrating in UX Design. I am pursing a minor in Business as well.</p>
      <p>Originally an environmental science major, my passion for design emerged when I took my first website design course. I immediately became dedicated to updating and perfecting my sites, for hours at a time.
        I wanted my work to be the best it could be, and was extremely satisfied with my work by the end of the semester. Due to my success in the class, I was hired as a teaching assistant, and this has allowed me to refine and master my skills. I found it highly rewarding to assist and guide other students. </p>
      <p>Outside of academics, I am a starting sabrest for the Cornell Fencing Team. Being a varsity athlete has taught me how to be highly efficient with my time as the team has practice every weekday, and I am often traveling on weekends.
        I am also a research assistant for the Virtual Embodiment Lab. The lab explores a variety of virtual reality devices from 360-degree video to full virtual systems. I have run experiments, helped create avatars, and designed 360-degree videos. </p>
      <p>I am always looking for new opportunities to create, design or just discuss new ideas and projects! Feel free to get in touch with the links below!</p>
